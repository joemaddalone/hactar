# Project Brief: hactar

Hactar is a Node.js CLI tool designed to gather and display detailed information about files stored within libraries on a Plex Media Server. It helps users manage their storage by providing insights into file sizes, formats, and library organization.

## Core Goals

- Interface with the Plex Media Server API to retrieve library metadata.
- Calculate and display storage usage (bytes, counts) at various levels (Library, Show, Season, Episode, Movie).
- Provide a CLI experience for easy access to these insights.
- Support configuration for server connection details.

## Success Criteria

- Successful connection to local or remote Plex servers.
- Accurate reporting of file sizes and counts.
- Intuitive CLI commands for scanning and viewing library data.
