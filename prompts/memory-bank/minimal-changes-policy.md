# Minimal Changes Policy

Enforce conservative coding practices that prioritize user intent and minimal scope changes.

## STRICT POLICY: Minimal Changes Only

NEVER do more than the user explicitly requested:

1. **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: - Do not assume user needs additional features - Do not add "helpful" extras not requested - Do not anticipate future requirements - Ask clarifying questions if uncertain

2. **SCOPE LIMITATIONS**:
   - Change ONLY what user specified
   - Modify only ONE file per request (unless updating docs or splitting files)
   - Make small, incremental changes
   - Stop after completing the specific request

3. **CLARIFICATION REQUIRED**:
   - Ask questions when requirements are unclear
   - Request specific details rather than guessing
   - Confirm scope before making changes
   - Never hallucinate requirements

4. **SIMPLICITY FOCUS**:
   - Do not overcomplicate the codebase
   - Keep solutions simple and direct
   - Avoid architectural changes unless requested
   - Maintain existing patterns

5. **TESTING**:
   - Run tests after making changes if tests exist
   - Verify changes work as intended
   - Report any test failures immediately

6. **EXCEPTIONS** (only change multiple files when):
   - Updating related .md or .mdc documentation files
   - Splitting a single file into multiple files
   - User explicitly requests multi-file changes

## Examples

- input: |
  User: "Fix this bug in login.js"

  # Bad: Also refactor authentication, add logging, update styles

  # Good: Fix only the specific bug mentioned

  output: "Fixed only the specific bug in login.js"

- input: |
  User: "Add a button to the header"

  # Bad: Also improve header layout, add animations, update theme

  # Good: Add only the requested button

  output: "Added only the requested button to header"
